principle - a principle is basic/ general truth that must be followed and must not be voilated 

SOLID principles are set of principles which must be followed to develop flexible , maintainable and scalable software systems .

they are  conceptualized by Robert C. Martin

Design patterns are concrte and solution to a specific kind of problems in software development .

SOLID 

S Single Responsibility principle  

This principle states that “a class should have only one reason to change” which means every class should have a single responsibility or single job or single purpose

O  Open / Close principle

This principle states that “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification” which means you should be able to extend a class behavior, without modifying it.


L LiskoV Substitution principle

This principle states that “Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes”. In other words, if class A is a subtype of class B, then we should be able to replace B with A without interrupting the behavior of the program.

I  Interface Segregation principle

This principle is the first principle that applies to Interfaces instead of classes in SOLID and it is similar to the single responsibility principle. It states that “do not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them“.

D  Dependency Inversion principle

The principle states that we must use abstraction (abstract classes and interfaces) instead of concrete implementations. High-level modules should not depend on the low-level module but both should depend on the abstraction
